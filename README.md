# Basic-Linear-Regression
Example of gradient descent to get the best fit line on a set of data


While taking a stats class, the teacher never explained how best fit line was actually determined. I decided I would try to figure out how to do it. I hadn't taken
calculus 3, so I was unfamiliar with gradient descent. I explored for a few hours how a simple linear regression could be completed and came up with this, which I later
found out this method was called gradient descent.
